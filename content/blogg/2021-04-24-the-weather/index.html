<p>After moving to Skagaströnd I became a weather enthusiast. The weather here has such clear patterns that I hadn’t realized before. In winter a north-east wind brings snow from the highlands that piles up behind every obsticle downwind, so houses that have front doors not facing the blizzard are covered with snow.</p>

<p>Not a single snowflake comes from the clouds above, it’s all from the highlands in the north east, and it’s densely packed snow powder. Southern winds are more frequent in winter but they don’t have the same effect. The winters have dominating N-NE winds and S-SW winds, the pattern in summer is different with diurnal effects.</p>
