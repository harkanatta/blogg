<p>We are a family of five and live in a little village, in the north of Iceland, called Skagaströnd. We came here for a job and have stayed a bit longer than we expected (since the spring of 2015). Our kids have become proud villagers and one of them is born here, he was born in 2016 but his older sisters were born 2008 and 2010.</p>
<p>I did not take the traditional route in my education, I made some shorter stops here and there on the job market and had a good time drumming and playing basketball in my early twenties, those skills have proved important later on socially. Today I coach junior basketball and play the drums at various occations.</p>
