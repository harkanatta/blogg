<p>Me, my wife and our three kids live in a little village called Skagaströnd in the north of Iceland. We came here for a job but have stayed longer than we expected (since the spring of 2015). Our kids have become proud villagers (skagstrendingar) and are absolutely opposed to moving anywhere else.</p>
