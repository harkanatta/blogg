# Sankey diagram

The main sources of microplastics in Iceland and pathways to the ocean are represented in this interactive Sankey-diagram below. Even though we haven't yet confirmed rubber tires in great quantities in ocean sediments we theorise that rubber and road particles are washed to the sea with surface water. There is no doubt these particles exist and persist in the environment.

In Húnaflói bay, northern Iceland, there is little microplastic pollution because of very few inhabitants. We still hvar a monitoring program in the summertime. We mostly get fibers and flakes and half of them are maybe pollution from our boat and sampling equipment. But we will find out when we get access to the Raman spectroscope.
