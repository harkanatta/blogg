      <description>After moving to SkagastrÃ¶nd I became a weather enthusiast. The weather here has such clear patterns that I hadnâ€™t realized before. In winter a north-east wind brings snow from the highlands that piles up behind every obsticle downwind, so houses that have front doors not facing the blizzard are covered with snow.

      <description>The ministry of environment requested an estimate of microplastic pollution to Icelandic seas. The main goal was to obtain information about the main sources and pathways to be able to react with political action if necessary. A part of the goal was to write a overview on the state of knowledge about microplastics regarding the marine environment especially. The outcome was a report (in Icelandic).</description>

      <description>In summertime we marine biologist get to venture out in the sun. Despite regular winds most of the year, summers here are great. But at these high latitudes they are short, only about 3 months. Unfortunately for me, I can get sea sick but still I manage to work my way around it.

      <description>We are a family of five and live in a little village, in the north of Iceland, called SkagastrÃ¶nd. We came here for a job and have stayed a bit longer than we expected (since the spring of 2015). Our kids have become proud villagers and one of them is born here, he was born in 2016 but his older sisters were born 2008 and 2010.
I did not take the traditional route in my education, I made some shorter stops here and there on the job market and had a good time drumming and playing basketball in my early twenties, those skills have proved important later on socially.</description>
