      <description>People enjoy interactive charts. RStudio offers Shiny apps which require running R to support it so I find that complicated. Instead of a Shiny application it’s possible to embed a D3 visualisation into R markdown files. Going from R code to D3 is not a small step and getting the hang takes a long time but there is inspiration to be found here
The visualization below was forked and adapted from a Github repository.</description>

      <description>Þetta skráir sig ekki sjálftGögn eru dýrmæt ef þau eru aðgengileg. Opnir gagnagrunnar geta verið mjög mikilvægir fyrir rannsóknir ef þeir yfirgripsmiklir. Gagnagrunnurinn GBIF (stendur fyrir Global Biodiversity Information Facility). Það er gagnagrunnur þar sem skráð eru tilvik þar sem ýmsar lífverur hafa sést eða veiðst. Til þess að lífvera sé skráð í gagnagrunn þarf bæði hún og skrásetjarinn að vera til staðar.</description>

      <description>In summertime we marine biologist get to venture out in the sun. Despite regular winds most of the year summers here are great. It is highly unfortunate for me that I am very sea sick but still I manage to work my way around it.

      <description>Me, my wife and our three kids live in a little village called Skagaströnd in the north of Iceland. We came here for a job but have stayed longer than we expected (since the spring of 2015). Our kids have become proud villagers (skagstrendingar) and are absolutely opposed to moving anywhere else.
I work as a marine biologist at BioPol and I am also employed by the regional Nature center (in icelandic: Náttúrustofu Norðurlands vestra).</description>
